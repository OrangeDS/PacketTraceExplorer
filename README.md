TCPDUMP Packet Trace Explorer
===================

This project is developed by me for doing various tcpdump based traffic analysis. There are some packet level analysis as well as some TCP flow level analysis.

The results are published in our SIGCOMM'13 paper: An In-depth Study of LTE: Effect of Network Protocol and Application Behavior on Performance (http://umich.edu/~hjx/file/sigcomm13.pdf).

Sorry for the poor documentation in this project which was done during my PhD.
